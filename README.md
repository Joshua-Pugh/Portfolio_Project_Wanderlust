# Wanderlust Full Stack Portfolio (In Progress)

This is a full-stack web application I’m building to strengthen my skills in the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js).

**Live Demo:** Coming Soon  
**Current Stage:** API development + MongoDB integration

## Why I Built This
In my full stack course, most of our work relied on templated projects and limited interaction with backend systems. I wanted to go deeper—building something end-to-end, learning how to wire together the front end, backend APIs, database logic, and admin routing myself.

## Features (Planned)
- [x] Static site with landing, about, and contact pages
- [ ] MongoDB database integration for user/contact data
- [ ] RESTful API endpoints for each page
- [ ] Admin dashboard with login protection and CRUD controls
- [ ] Deployed version with GitHub Actions / Heroku / Render

## Tech Stack
- Angular
- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB (local for now, moving to Atlas)
- Git for version control

## Repo Status
This project is actively being developed and updated as I build new features. I welcome feedback and suggestions!
